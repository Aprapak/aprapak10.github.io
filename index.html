            <h2>SEO Techniques</h2>
            <p>Meta descriptions, as one can imagine, are building blocks of SEO. They describe what a web page is about in a snippet format that appears below the title of the page in search results. A well-structured meta description increases click-through rates radically by making the webpage more relevant to the users. Websites improve in their visibility through search algorithms by incorporating targeted keywords into a meta description, reflecting what the user is looking for, thus increasing reach and efficiency (Moz, n.d.).</p>
            <p>Another crucial SEO strategy includes descriptive page titles. These are what show up in search engine results pages and help both the user and the search engine know what's on the page. With good page titles, relevant keywords are integrated to stipulate what's on the page, thus enhancing the possibility of securing better rankings within SERPs. Another important reason crafting unique titles for each page enhances the general authority and relevance of a website, which in turn is considered crucial in SEO strategy (Yoast, n.d.).</p>
            <p>Heading tags, such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, are valuable in properly structuring the content of a webpage. They enhance the reading experience for users by making it easier for search engines to index the content. When keywords are placed strategically within heading tags, they contribute toward the ranking of a page in a search engine through emphasis on its relevance and clarity. Well-structured headings also make for a better user experience, where they make sure the content is accessible and easy to navigate (Search Engine Journal, n.d.).

            <h2>SMO Techniques</h2>
            <p>Social media sharing buttons, like the 'Like' button by Facebook, have increased SMO to a greater extent. It enables users to share content effortless with their networking sites, thus increasing the spread of a website. In addition, social shares are good backlinks for search engine rankings. The dual advantage related to this has made social media sharing buttons an influential tool in driving traffic and engagement (Buffer, n.d.).</p>
            <p>Creating direct links to social media platforms, like Instagram, fosters engagement and builds a strong brand presence. For example, linking to TMU's Instagram page encourages users to follow the institution, stay updated with its posts, and interact with its content. This increases brand visibility and user connection while simplifying the process for users to access updates. Establishing such links also builds trust and credibility by showcasing an active and transparent social presence (Hootsuite, 2023).</p>
            <p>Optimizing content specifically for social media platforms is one effective SMO strategy that strengthens user interaction. This is done by using captivating visuals, appropriate hashtags, and short but punchy captions targeted for the platforms like Instagram or Twitter. Such optimization not only increases likes and comments but also strengthens the website's overall online presence by driving more users to the site through engaging content (Sprout Social, 2023).</p>
